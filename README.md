# Data Exploration and Analysis Project

This project aims to demonstrate basic data exploration and analysis using Python. It incorporates various Python libraries commonly used in data analytics, with a particular focus on the Pandas library.

## Features and Highlights

- Utilizes essential Python libraries for data analytics.
- Focuses on exploring and analyzing data using the Pandas library.
- Provides introductory explanations and examples of Pandas functions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `Hotels data project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data exploration and analysis code.
- `csv_data.csv`: Sample dataset used for the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To run the code and explore the data analysis project, follow these steps:
